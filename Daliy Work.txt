 Route File configurations for SIT Blue-Green / Active-Passive setup
 -------------------------------------------------------------------
 (Ravi Raja, Sudhakar Vasi reddy, Suryateja)
 
We are in the process of doing a blue-green / active-passive setup for our QA environments. 
As notified before, we would need your help in doing the route file configurations/changes based on the header parameters.

Below are the VIPs newly created by Sudhakar, Please reach out to him for clarifications.
mbqa2bg.sdc.vzwcorp.com   ------  Application URL
-----------------------
mbaccmgrqa2bg.sdc.vzwcorp.com ---IG load balancer
-----------------------------

mb versus kb   active server & passive server

mbt1-> Active -> pointer -> IG1 -> loginpage
mbt2-> Passive -> IG1 -> mbt2

IG1 -> Passive : yes -> mbt2
IG1 -> Passive : no ->  mbt1

load balancer
-------------
mbt, route -xyz

if host = "mbqa2bg.sdc.vzwcorp.com" fwd to mbt2  (deployment)
if host = "mbqa2.sdc.vzwcorp.com" fwd to mbt2 

QA team: header plot ------IG decide what server run backend.

To start with, we have chosen QA2 for this exercise, so initially we need your help in doing this route configuration only for QA2. Later we can repeat the exercise for QA1 and QA3 as well.
